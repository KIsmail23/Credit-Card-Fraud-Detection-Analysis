# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection-Analysis
This project focuses on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using data analysis and machine learning techniques.


## 📌 Project Overview:

The goal is to identify suspicious transactions accurately while minimizing false alarms.

Fraud detection is a real-world problem faced by banks and financial institutions, making this project highly relevant for data science, analytics, and finance roles.
--- 
## 🎯 Objectives

- Understand patterns in fraudulent vs. genuine transactions

- Handle highly imbalanced data

- Build and evaluate models for fraud detection

- Measure performance using appropriate metrics like ROC-AUC
--- 
## 🧰 Tools & Technologies Used

Python

Jupyter Notebook

Pandas & NumPy – data manipulation

Matplotlib & Seaborn – data visualization

Scikit-learn – machine learning & model evaluation
--- 
📊 Dataset Description

The dataset contains credit card transactions

Each row represents a transaction
--- 
The target variable:

0 → Normal transaction

1 → Fraudulent transaction

- Data is highly imbalanced, which reflects real-world scenarios
